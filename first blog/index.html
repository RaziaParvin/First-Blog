         <p><strong>Exercise</strong> gets your heart pumping and the blood flowing, increasing your circulation to move more blood and oxygen 
            throughout the body. Regular exercise also improves your <b>blood circulation</b> when you’re not exercising. All that extra blood
             nourishes your skin cells, providing vital nutrients.The increased blood flow that brings helpful nutrients to your
              skin cells also removes harmful toxins. Your bloodstream acts as a superhighway. You’ve got trucks bringing helpful
               nutrients to all of the stops along the route.Stress can cause all kinds of damage to your body. It can alter your
                skin’s natural protective function, cause acne, and increase the severity of certain skin diseases. Exercise has 
                been shown to help manage and reduce stress by causing the release of feel-good endorphins.</p>

                from authentice page so that it won't cause any harm to our face.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sofiasbh11" target="blank_">
